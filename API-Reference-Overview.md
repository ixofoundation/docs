# API Reference

The IXO Spatial Web API is extensive and covers multiple domains.\
This documentation describes the Create, Read, Update, Delete, and List (CRUDL) functions for these domains. The systems involved in providing these functions are the IXO Impact Hub Blockchain, the IXO Blocksync block indexer, and the IXO Data Matrix. Each of these systems provide a specific part of the API.\
TODO: Elaborate on the API's attributes and gurantees. For example, _"organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs."_
You are able to use the IXO Spatial Web API in test mode by changing the server endpoints to our testnet blockchain. None of the transactions performed on the testnet blockchain involves tokens or data that are real and are not guaranteed to be available in the future. Ensure that you use anonymous and mock data in test mode.
