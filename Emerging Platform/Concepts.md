# Core Concepts for Developers

## Overview
The [Emerging Platform](https://emerging.eco) is a next-generation software infrastructure for coordinating, financing, verifying, governing, and growing intelligence about energy transition in emerging economies.

Core features of the platform include decentralized digital Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (dMRV), digital certification, financing, and registry management of climate impact assets and climate actions. 

By integrating data from IoT devices, blockchain networks, and external services into digital twins of real-wprld systems, the platform ensures transparent, verifiable records and supports compliance with local and global climate impact mitigation, social, and economic development goals.

The platform is implemented with the IXO Spatial Web (blockchain, AI and verifiable data) software stack.

## Key Components

### Digital MRV (dMRV)
Digital Measurement, Reporting, and Verification underpins all data-driven processes on the platform. It offers:
• Automated data collection from diverse sensors and IoT devices  
• Real-time climate impact tracking and analytics  
• Standardized reporting to ensure data consistency  
• Secure and auditable validation mechanisms  

### Digital Certification
The platform’s certification framework provides:
• Tamper-proof digital credential issuance  
• Ongoing validation of climate impact claims  
• Clear provenance tracking for credentials  
• Blockchain-based credential verification  

### Digital Registry
The decentralized registry manages the lifecycle of climate impact assets, facilitating:
• End-to-end tracking of asset creation and transfers  
• Integration with recognized climate standards  
• Immutable audit trails, backed by blockchain  
• Streamlined processes for verifying ownership  

### ITMO Credentials
For Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs), the platform ensures:
• Standardized credential formats and metadata  
• Alignment with the Paris Agreement Article 6 requirements  
• Reliable cross-border transfer support  
• Mechanisms for implementing corresponding adjustments  

## Technical Architecture

### Blockchain Layer
• Maintains immutable records of transactions and data  
• Manages smart contract execution  
• Offers robust data integrity guarantees  
• Powers the dMRV, digital certification, and registry functionalities  

### Data Layer
• Receives and validates inputs from sensors, APIs, and other data sources  
• Applies security protocols for data storage  
• Employs data governance policies to maintain confidentiality  
• Facilitates fast retrieval through optimized data structures  

### Integration Layer
• Connects external systems and services via standardized interfaces  
• Supports REST, GraphQL, and WebSocket protocols  
• Ensures interoperability with existing enterprise platforms  
• Enables consistent data exchange in multiple formats  

### Artificial Intelligence
The Emerging Platform harnesses AI through:
• IXO Oracles for secure data ingestion and processing  
• Analytics that identify patterns in climate-related metrics  
• Automated real-time verification of dMRV inputs  
• Workflow automation and intelligent decision support  

## Developer Resources

### API Access
Developers gain access to platform capabilities through:
• RESTful endpoints for straightforward integration  
• GraphQL for flexible, query-based data retrieval  
• WebSocket connections for real-time event streaming  
• SDKs tailored to common programming languages  

## Best Practices

### Security
• Implement strong authentication measures and token management  
• Use HTTPS or equivalent secure protocols for data transmission  
• Leverage encryption for sensitive data at rest and in transit  
• Conduct frequent security audits to identify potential vulnerabilities  

### Scalability
• Utilize horizontal scaling techniques across application tiers  
• Employ caching layers to handle high-volume data requests  
• Optimize queries and data structures for faster performance  
• Proactively monitor and balance system loads  

### Compliance
• Align with relevant climate impact frameworks and standards  
• Comply with jurisdiction-specific data protection laws  
• Maintain immutable audit logs and transaction records  
• Validate updates and changes through transparent verification  

## Getting Started
1. Sign up for developer credentials on the Emerging Platform.  
2. Consult the comprehensive API documentation.  
3. Set up a local development environment and sample test project.  
4. Integrate platform APIs or SDKs into your application.

## Next Steps
