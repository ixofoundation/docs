# Definitions

## Platform & Infrastructure Terms

**Emerging Platform**: A domain-specific platform built on IXO Spatial Web infrastructure, focused on Modern Energy Cooking and climate impact mitigation solutions.

**IXO Spatial Web**: The underlying infrastructure that powers the Emerging Platform.

**Digital Twin**: A digital representation of real-world entities with unique identifiers, where information is securely stored and managed with AI-enabled services.

**Domain**: A unique digital space assigned to each Digital Twin, managed as an NFT that can be owned and transferred.

## Network Types

**dePIN**: Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks - networks of IoT-enabled cooking devices and related hardware.

**deHAN**: Decentralized Human Agent Networks - networks for coordinating human distribution and customer support agents.

**deAI**: Decentralized AI services - intelligent Oracles delivering AI-enabled services to platform users.

## Entity Types

**Legal Entities**: Organizations responsible for designing, implementing, and managing Clean Cooking projects.

**Project Entities**: Specific mitigation activities or programs for energy transition and climate impact solutions.

**Asset Entities**: Physical resources (like devices) or tokenized outcomes (like carbon credits).

**Protocol Entities**: Templates, workflows, rules, and standards governing various processes.

**Oracle Entities**: Verifiable AI-enabled services implementing Protocols for automating platform functions, such as claim processing and decision-support.

## Technical Terms

**Interchain Identifier (IID)**: A system for managing unique self-sovereign digital identifiers (DIDs) on the IXO Protocol blockchain networks.

**Entity Module**: Component that generates deterministic DID identifiers for authentication.

**Data Graph**: An interconnected network of Digital Twins providing system-level visibility into trends and outcomes.

**dMRV**: Digital Measurement, Reporting, and Verification - system for end-to-end measurement and validation of climate impact.

**Smart Contract**: Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code and stored on a blockchain.

**Web3**: A decentralized version of the internet built on public blockchains, incorporating concepts like decentralization, token-based economics, and self-sovereign identity. 

**VC**: Verifiable Credential

**IRI**: Internationalized Resource Identifier

## Carbon Market Terms

**NDC**: Nationally Determined Contribution


**ITMOs**: Internationally-transferred Mitigation Outcomes - standardized certificates for carbon credit transfers.

**MoPAs**: Mitigation Outcome Purchase Agreements - agreements for distributing proceeds from carbon credits.

## Security & Validation Terms

**Write-Once-Read-Many Architecture**: A design ensuring data can only be appended, never modified or deleted, maintaining an unalterable audit trail.

**Zero-Trust Security**: A comprehensive security approach requiring authentication for all operations with role-based access restrictions.

**Distributed Consensus**: A system where multiple independent nodes maintain synchronized copies of data and cross-validate new records.

**Cryptographic Validation**: Security mechanism using hashes, digital signatures, and timestamps to ensure data integrity.

**VERs**: Verified Emission Reductions - carbon credits verified through the platform.
