# Digital MRV

## Introduction  
The [Emerging Platform](https://emerging.eco) implements the market-leading [IXO](https://ixo.world) dMRV protocols and software systems for managing data related to clean cooking initiatives, and to generate evidence for Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs).

IXO dMRV provides a transparent, secure, and verifiable foundation for managing data related to clean cooking initiatives and Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs). 

By employing decentralized identifiers (DIDs), verifiable claims, and causal AI, this platform supports end-to-end data recording, validation, and reporting aligned with Article 6.2 requirements of the Paris Agreement. Its underlying structure captures granular real-world activity (fuel purchases, deliveries, and device usage) in a privacy-compliant manner, while offering:

**Household-Level Reporting**  
Consolidates data across multiple devices and fuel sources for a single household.

**Monitoring and Tracking**  
Observes usage of multiple devices and fuels within each household, to ensure accurate accounting for stove-stacking and to calculate mitigation outcomes without double-counting.

**Rich Data Graph**  
Links all entities and claims into a connected graph, facilitating deeper insights into system behavior.

**Time-Sequenced, Immutable Records** 
Stores all claims and credentials on a public blockchain-backed dMRV registry for full traceability.


## Advantages of IXO dMRV

#### Systems-Level Insights  
By modeling physical and cognitive elements as interconnected digital entities, developers can track stove-stacking, fuel-switching, and other system dynamics in real time.

#### Trust and Transparency  
Immutable records and verifiable credentials assure stakeholders that project data is authentic, reducing disputes over ITMO claims or carbon credits.

#### Simplified Entity Management  
Protocols deliver ready-made configurations, lowering the complexity of domain creation and maintenance.

#### Automation Potential  
Decentralized workflows, verification, and payments can be programmed to run without intermediaries, improving efficiency.

### Enhanced Decision-Making  
High-resolution data streams offer evidence-based oversight, helping organizations optimize clean cooking initiatives and ensure compliance with Article 6.2 requirements under the Paris Agreement.
