# Registry

## Decentralized Clean Cooking Registry

The Emerging Platform leverages the Impact Hub Network to provide a decentralized, globally-distributed public registry service designed for the digital Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (dMRV) of Article 6.2 activities. This registry underpins the platform’s commitment to transparent, verifiable, and privacy-preserving documentation of mitigation efforts and outcomes.

### Core Elements of the Registry

The Impact Hub Network Registry supports the following components of Article 6 Mitigation Activities:

- **Mitigation Activities**: Documentation of activities contributing to emission reductions.
- **Projects**: Registration and tracking of projects under mitigation efforts.
- **Agents**: Identification and validation of participating entities.
- **Activity Implementers**: Credentialing of organizations executing mitigation activities.
- **Authorizations**: Record of approvals for specific mitigation actions.
- **Claims**: Submission and tracking of digital claims for verified outcomes.
- **Certificates**: Issuance of digital certificates validating claims.
- **Credits**: Tokenized outcomes representing verified mitigation efforts.
- **Inventories**: Comprehensive records of assets and credits associated with mitigation activities.

### Privacy and Trust

The registry operates as a Digital Public Good through a public blockchain infrastructure hosted by a globally-distributed network of independent Validator Node operators. All data within the registry is privacy-preserving:

- **Self-Sovereign Digital Identifiers**: Entities maintain full control over their identifiers, ensuring data sovereignty.
- **No PII Storage**: Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is never stored on the blockchain, adhering to strict privacy standards.

This trust framework enables authentication and independent verification of all claims and data related to Article 6 Mitigation Activities.

### Registry Functions

The Emerging Platform Registry offers the following services for dMRV processes:

1. **[Registration](Registration.md)**: Onboarding of projects, agents, and activities.
2. **Credential Issuance**: Provision of verified credentials for authorized entities.
3. **[Claims Submissions](Claims-Submissions.md)**: Secure submission of digital claims.
4. **[Claims Evaluations](Claims-Evaluations.md)**: Verification and validation of submitted claims.
5. **[Self-Certification](Self-Certification.md)**: Enabling entities to self-certify their actions with robust audit trails.
6. **[Credits Issuance](Credits-Issuance.md)**: Generation of tokenized credits for verified outcomes.
7. **[Credits Transfers](Credits-Transfers.md)**: Secure and traceable transfer of tokenized credits.
8. **[Credits Retirements](Credits-Retirements.md)**: Permanent retirement of credits to account for emissions reductions.
9. **[International Settlements](International-Settlements.md)**: Cross-border trading and settlement of tokenized credits.
10. **[Audits](Audits.md)**: Comprehensive review and verification of activities and claims.

### Building with the Registry

Developers can integrate with the registry to create applications and tools that:

- Support real-time tracking and verification of mitigation activities.
- Manage the lifecycle of tokenized credits from issuance to retirement.
- Enhance transparency and accountability in Article 6 Mitigation Activities.

The registry’s infrastructure, combined with the Emerging Platform’s suite of APIs and tools, provides a robust foundation for scalable and impactful solutions. Dive into the documentation to explore how you can build and innovate with the Emerging Platform Registry.
