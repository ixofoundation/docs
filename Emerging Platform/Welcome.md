## Welcome Developers

Welcome to the developer documentation for the Emerging Platform, an innovative ecosystem accelerating the adoption of regenerative household solutions in emerging economies. Built on the IXO Spatial Web infrastructure, this comprehensive platform integrates advanced IoT technologies, blockchain, and artificial intelligence to revolutionize modern energy cooking and climate impact mitigation. By offering tools to monitor, verify, and incentivize sustainable practices, Emerging empowers developers, project managers, and device distributors to create impactful and scalable solutions.

For more information, please visit the [Emerging website](https://emerging.eco) and explore the [Emerging Mission Control](https://app.emerging.eco) application to access services, domain knowledge, and the Companion AI agent.

### Key Features of the Emerging Platform

1. **Decentralised Physical Infrastructure (dePIN) Networks**: Each IoT-enabled cooking device is paired with a programmable digital twin within a decentralized registry. These digital assets are more than digital replicas—they act as programmable assets that represent rights to future Impact Credits, enabling real-time verification and tokenization of carbon credits and other sustainability outcomes. Digital twins also coordinate networks of distributed devices, transforming them into utility-scale infrastructure capable of delivering scalable, decentralized services such as modern energy cooking, while supporting real-time monitoring and optimization.

2. **Mission Control**: This comprehensive tool allows developers and project managers to monitor device networks, manage digital claims, automate payments, and optimize service delivery through an intuitive dashboard and with the assistance of AI.

3. **Real-Time Impact Certification**: The platform processes data from IoT sensors and transactions to generate digital claims, which are verified in real-time by decentralized dMRV (digital Measurement, Reporting, and Verification) services. The result is the issuance of high-definition digital certificates backed by verification proofs.

4. **Tokenized Impact Credits**: Verified sustainability outcomes are tokenized into tradable Outcome Units. These units, supported by digital certificates and verification proofs, can be used for carbon offsets, Internationally-transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs), traded across blockchain networks, or integrated into digital finance protocols.

5. **Customer Utility Services**: Emerging provides a seamless onboarding process for end-users, including digital credentials, payment processing, and customer support. AI-driven agents enhance the delivery of clean cooking as a utility service, ensuring sustainable and scalable business models.

6. **AI-Powered Analytics**: The platform’s AI tools integrate business intelligence, market insights, and performance analytics. Developers can leverage these tools to identify trends, enhance impact measurement, and make data-driven decisions.

7. **IoT Integration and Inventory Management**: Control and monitor networks of IoT-connected cooking devices while efficiently managing and distributing devices and fuels as tokenized assets.

8. **Payment Processing and Digital Wallets**: Facilitate payments for fuel and related services using digital vouchers and integrations with mobile money (MobiPay) gateways. Every household user is provided with a digital wallet, mobile-first decentralized application, digital identity credentials, and a personal data vault.

9. **Outcome Tokenization and Registry Services**: Generate tokenized units of outcomes and manage the lifecycle of registry assets—including Projects, Devices, and Credits—through stages of issuance, retirement, and transfers.

10. **Carbon Market Integration**: Manage authorizations for Verified Emission Reductions (VERs) and ITMOs, interfacing with national carbon registries and international reporting systems.

11. **Advanced Analytics and Audits**: Query and process on-chain and off-chain data using graph-based queries, and perform third-party execution of dMRV procedures using zero-knowledge proofs to validate Verifiable Credentials.

### Building with Emerging

As a developer, you have access to a suite of tools and APIs designed to simplify integration and enhance functionality. The platform supports:
