# Errors

IXO Spatial Web uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Generally speaking:

- Codes in the 2xx range indicate success.
- Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed and may include information to explain the reason.
  - Some 4xx errors are handled programmatically and include an error code to explain the issue.
- Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with the IXO Spatial Web servers.
