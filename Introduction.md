# Introduction to the IXO Spatial Web

The **IXO Spatial Web** is a decentralised technology ecosystem that connects blockchain, identity management, smart contracts, and conversational AI to enable trusted and verifiable interactions across social, environmental, and economic domains. It serves as a robust foundation for building decentralised applications (dApps) and solutions that can measure, manage, and report on real-world impacts.

This introduction provides a comprehensive overview of everything included in the IXO Spatial Web, highlighting its core components, tools, SDKs, APIs, and resources.

## Core Components of the IXO Spatial Web

The Spatial Web is composed of several decentralised technologies that enable developers and organisations to create applications that interact with real-world data, entities, and verifiable digital assets.

### 1. IXO Blockchain
The IXO Blockchain serves as the foundational Layer-1 appchain of the Spatial Web, enabling:
- **Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs)**: Secure identity creation and management.
- **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**: Cryptographically signed and trusted data.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automate decentralised workflows and transactions.
- **Governance**: On-chain governance tools for decentralised decision-making.

### 2. Identity and Verifiable Data
The Spatial Web utilises **Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs)** and **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)** to enable trust in digital interactions. Entities, projects, and individuals can establish self-sovereign identities and interact securely with verified information.

- **DID Provider X SDK**: Simplifies the creation and management of DIDs on the IXO blockchain.
- **Matrix State Bot**: Manages decentralised storage of identity-related state and ACL (Access Control List) data.

### 3. APIs and Gateways
The Spatial Web provides a suite of APIs to interact with blockchain data, identity systems, and decentralised storage:
- **IXO Blocksync GraphQL API**: Retrieve and query blockchain data in a developer-friendly manner.
- **gRPC Gateway API**: REST-based interface for accessing gRPC blockchain services.
- **Matrix State Bot API**: Manage identity states and ACLs in Matrix rooms.

### 4. SDKs and Tools
The IXO Spatial Web offers modular SDKs to accelerate development and integration:
- **IXO Spatial Web Multiclient SDK**: Core SDK for interacting with the IXO blockchain.
- **SignX SDK**: Enables secure multi-transaction signing and mobile-to-web authentication.
- **Matrix Client SDK**: Tools for interacting with the Matrix communication network.
- **Oracles UI SDK**: Dynamic UI components for integrating AI-driven tools and workflows.
- **JAMBO Wallet SDK**: Integrates blockchain wallet functionality for web and mobile.

These SDKs are designed to work together, enabling developers to build scalable, user-friendly decentralised applications.

## Development Tools and Environments

The Spatial Web supports developers with tools and environments that facilitate application creation, testing, and deployment:

- **Testnets and Devnets**: Access dedicated testing environments for experimentation.
- **IXO dAppStore on Opera**: A decentralised marketplace to host and access dApps within the Spatial Web.

---

## Key Features

The IXO Spatial Web is built to address critical challenges in verifiable data management, trust, and decentralisation:

- **Self-Sovereign Identity**: Empower individuals and organisations to own and manage their identities.
- **Impact Verification**: Report and verify claims about real-world social and environmental outcomes.
- **Blockchain Interoperability**: Enable decentralised transactions and workflows across blockchain networks.
- **AI-Powered Applications**: Integrate AI tools to automate workflows and enhance decision-making processes.

## Building Applications on the IXO Spatial Web

Developers and organisations can use the Spatial Web to build dApps that deliver trusted outcomes. Key steps include:

1. **Set Up Your Development Environment**:
   - Use the provided SDKs to interact with the IXO blockchain and APIs.
   - Access testing environments (Testnet, Devnet) for experimentation.

2. **Leverage the IXO SDKs**:
   - Integrate core functionalities such as DID management, wallets, and AI components.
   - Explore SDK documentation for examples and implementation details.

3. **Access APIs**:
   - Use GraphQL, gRPC, and Matrix APIs to query blockchain data, manage identities, and store stateful data.

## Use Cases

The IXO Spatial Web enables innovative solutions across various sectors:

- **Social Impact Projects**: Measure, report, and verify project outcomes using trusted data.
- **Governance Systems**: Build tools for decentralised governance and community decision-making.
- **Decentralised Finance (DeFi)**: Create applications for staking, rewards, and peer-to-peer transactions.
- **AI-Enhanced Applications**: Integrate AI-driven workflows for enhanced automation and insights.
- **Identity Solutions**: Implement secure, self-sovereign digital identity systems.
