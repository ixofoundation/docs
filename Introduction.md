# Welcome Developers!

Welcome to the IXO Spatial Web developer documentation — your gateway to creating the future of decentralised, impact-driven applications. Whether you're building innovative projects or solving wicked problems, our infrastructure is here to help you bring your ideas to life.

## Why the IXO Spatial Web?

The IXO Spatial Web is more than just a full-stack solution — it's a platform that empowers you to create, measure, and manage decentralised solutions for digital finance, outcome tracking, and community infrastructure. Here's what makes it special:

- **Decentralised Infrastructure Management**: Tokenise and manage decentralised IoT devices and physical assets with ease.
- **Digital Identity & Credential Management**: Issue secure digital identities and verifiable credentials, ensuring user privacy and trust.
- **Payments & Tokenised Assets**: Integrate payment processing, manage tokenised assets, and offer a seamless financial experience.
- **Outcome Measurement & Verification (dMRV)**: Digitally measure and verify the impact of your projects, making transparency and accountability easy.
- **AI-Enabled Services**: Use AI to automate decisions, generate actionable insights, and enhance your app's value.
- **Tokenisation of Impact**: Register and manage outcomes as tokenised, verifiable units to ensure traceability for all stakeholders.
