# Welcome Developers

Welcome to the the developer documentation for the **Emerging Platform** for Modern Energy Cooking. This comprehensive platform is built on the IXO Spatial Web infrastructure, providing a powerful suite of tools and services that are designed to revolutionize modern energy cooking solutions and to enable climate impact mitigation activities to reach an Internet-scale.

For more information about the platform, please visit the [Emerging website](https://emerging.eco) and the [Emerging Mission Control](https://app.emerging.eco) client application where you can access the services of the platform. Here you can also access domain knowledge about Modern Emergy Cooking and ask any questions you may have about the IXO Spatial Web, by interacting with the Companion AI agent.

## Platform Overview

**Emerging** is a domain-specific platform for Modern Energy Cooking and household-targeted sustainable socio-economic development and climate impact mitigation. 
This offers a full-stack solution for:
- **dePIN:** Financing, deploying, and controlling decentralized physical infrastructure networks (dePIN) of IoT-connected modern energy cooking devices, and related hardware such as Internet routers
- **deHAN**: Onboarding, coordinating, incentivizing, governing, and intelligently informing decentralized networks of human agents working as distribution and customer support agents
- **deAI**: Decentralized, autonomous AI-enabled services that are delivered as Intelligent Oracles to users of the platform
- **dMRV**: Digital Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (dMRV) of the outcomes generated by modern energy cooking activities. This covers both greenhouse gas emission reductions and broader social, environmental, and economic impacts.

## Key Features

- **Household Onboarding**: Streamline the process of integrating households into modern energy cooking services with digital identity credentials and by providing customers with digital wallets and accounts
- **Inventory Management**: Efficiently manage and distribute modern energy cooking devices and fuels as tokenised assets
- **Payment Processing**: Facilitate payments for fuel and related services using digital vouchers and integrations with mobile money (MobiPay) payment gateways
- **IoT Integration**: Control and monitor networks of IoT-connected cooking devices, fusing event data into the digital twin state-space of mitigation activity systems
- **Digital Claims Processing**: Submit and process claims through automated digital measurement, reporting, and verification mechanisms that use evaluation models powered by Casual AI
- **Digital Certification**: Issue Verifiable Credentials for Customers, Agents, Devices, Fuel Products, and Outcomes in standardized formats for reporting â€“ such as ITMO Certificates for Internationally-transferred Mitigation Outcomes
- **Outcome Tokenization**: Generate tokenized units of outcomes on a decentralized registry
- **Digital Registry**: Manage the life-cycle of registry assets, including Projects, Devices, and Credits through the stages of issuance, retirement, transfers, and transfers through chains of custody
- **Carbon Market Integration**: Manage authorizations for VERs and ITMOs, interfacing with national carbon registries and international reporting systems
- **Financial Distribution**: Distribute proceeds from Mitigation Outcome Purchase Agreements (MoPAs) in the form of digital vouchers
- **Advanced Analytics**: Query and process both on-chain and privately-stored offchain data, using graph-based queries
- **Audit**: Perform third-party execution of dMRV procedures and computation, to validate Verifiable Credentials with zero-Knowledge Proofs

## Getting Started

Reference the [IXO Spatial Web documentation](../../Introduction.md) to get going.

## Impacts of the Platform

### Impact on Carbon Markets

The implementation of dMRV through the Emerging Platform has significant implications for carbon markets, including higher quality credits, increased investor confidence, and market expansion.

### Impacts on Emerging Households

The Emerging Platform provides the foundations, tools and services for building decentralized finance and data-driven, AI-enabled services for Emerging Households to gain access to financial services, and to participate in the Green Economy. Every household user has a digital wallet, mobile-first decentralized application web app store, digital identity credentials, and a personal data vault.

## Imagine what You can Build

We're excited to see what you'll build with the Emerging Platform and using the powerful capabilities of the IXO Spatial Web!
