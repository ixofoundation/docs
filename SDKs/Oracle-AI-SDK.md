# Oracle AI SDK

The **IXO Oracle AI SDK** is a comprehensive toolkit designed to seamlessly integrate conversational AI capabilities, such as Guru AI, into web and mobile applications. By providing React hooks and utilities, this SDK empowers developers to manage AI interactions dynamically while maintaining a rich and interactive user experience.

## Key Features

### 1. Conversational AI Integration

The SDK enables applications to interface with conversational AI models, offering features like real-time message streaming and dynamic responses. Developers can:

- Create and manage multiple AI chat sessions.
- Send and receive AI-generated responses in real-time.
- Seamlessly switch between active AI sessions.

### 2. Dynamic UI Components

One of the standout features of the **IXO Oracle AI SDK** is its ability to dynamically render custom UI components based on AI output. These components, such as cards or forms, are dynamically resolved and displayed in response to specific AI events.

- **Tool Call Integration**: Automatically map AI-generated events to React components.
- **Custom Components**: Easily register and render application-specific components.
- **Loading States**: Indicate progress or waiting states dynamically while the AI processes requests.

### 3. Platform Versatility

The SDK is platform-agnostic, supporting both React DOM for web and React Native for mobile applications. This ensures a consistent development experience across environments.

- **Web Compatibility**: Use standard web components like `<div>`, `<button>`, and `<input>`.
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Integrate seamlessly with React Native/Expo components such as `<View>`, `<Text>`, and `<TextInput>`.

### 4. Real-Time Messaging Support

Through hooks like `useListMessages`, the SDK enables applications to:

- Fetch, maintain, and update message lists in real-time.
- Handle WebSocket connections for live updates.
- Dynamically resolve and display AI-generated messages as either text or React components.

## Use Cases

The **IXO Oracle AI SDK** is versatile and can be used in a variety of applications:

- **AI-Powered Chat Interfaces**: Build interactive chat UIs with real-time AI-driven responses.
- **Dynamic Content Rendering**: Create dynamic, data-driven UI components that respond to AI commands.
- **Custom AI Tools**: Develop AI-assisted tools and workflows tailored to specific user needs.
