# ixo MultiClient SDK

You can interact with the [ixo Blockchain](../getting-started/) using this SDK written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and hosted on the [npm Registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). All of the blockchain RPC messages, and more, at your fingertips!

You will find extensive documentation about this powerful tool in the Github repository [here](https://github.com/ixofoundation/ixo-multiclient-sdk).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The `tests` folder is especially helpful for understanding how to use the SDK.
