# JAMBO

This handy tool opens the door to [Opera Browser for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opera.browser\&referrer=af\_tranid%3DC3zHAor6Zux66XKdWJGGsQ%26pid%3Doperacom%26c%3Dwebpage%26utm\_source%3Doperacom%26utm\_campaign%3Dwebpage) with millions of users!

On top of that it plays nicely with the [Keplr Browser Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap?hl=en) for a seamless Web3 experience.

Detailed instructions in the JAMBO [Github repository](https://github.com/ixofoundation/jambo) make it really simple to use.
