# dMRV Registry

The Impact Hub Network provides a decentralised, globally-distributed public registry service for decentralised digital Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (dMRV) of Article 6:
- Mitigation Activities
- Projects
- Agents
- Activity Implementers
- Authorisations
- Claims
- Certificates
- Credits
- Inventories

The registry enables all claims and data relating to Article 6 Mitigation Activities to be authenticated and independently verified.

The registry is offered through a Digital Public Good public blockchain infrastructure –the Impact Hub– that is hosted by a network of globally-distributed independent Validator Node operators.

Digital Identifiers in the registry are self-sovereign and all records are privacy-preserving, with no personally-identifiable information (PII) stored on the public blockchain.
