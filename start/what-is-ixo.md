# Welcome to The Internet of Impacts

## Digital Infrastructure for the Impacts Economy

{% embed url="https://vimeo.com/264055837" %}
A founding vision shared in 2017
{% endembed %}

Our mission is to enable organisations across the world to coordinate, finance, deliver and verify Impacts at Internet-scale.

> ### The Internet of Impacts provides foundational digital infrastructure for the Impacts Economy

***

## The ixo Platform

**The ixo Platform** is an open-source software stack:

* **The ixo Layer 1 blockchain** is purpose-built to implement the ixo Protocol and related services for coordinating, financing, delivering, and verifying Impacts at Internet-scale.



***

## The ixo Protocol



**Verifiable Claims** capture tamper-proof and accountable digital records of the state of the world, about any imaginable subject.&#x20;

Claims are evaluated by independent trusted verification services (which ixo describes as **Prediction Oracles**).

**Verified claims** with their crypto-economic proofs and data assets are issued as  tokenised. For instance a Carbon Emission Reduction claim can produce a verified, information-rich Carbon Credit token.

**Tokenised Impact** makes the results of development processes more precisely measurable and valuable. Tokens can be traded and used in decentralised development finance mechanisms, such as ixo Alphabonds for Adaptive Financing.
